    "# Unit 3, Section 1.1: Data Types and Variables - Ederick\n",
    "\n",
    "## Essential Knowledge (College Board's Must Knows):\n",
    " * A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values).\n",
    " * Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables\n",
    " * Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings)\n",
    " * One form of a value is better suited for representation than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more comples values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be seen as \"containers\" and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold.\n",
    "In the following code, we can see that a variable has the value of \"Alex.\" How can we make the variable appear more organized in the code?\n",
    "\n",
    "![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/eddy1.png \"https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing Variables\n",
    "When choosing variables, it is important to assign the variables name to something that correlates with what the function of the variable is supposed to do. For example, we do not want a variable that is supposed to hold a name be named \"age\" becaue it can be confusing and mistakes may be more prevalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/eddy5.png \"https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notice how age is going to be seen when printing the code. That can lead to confusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* integer (numbers)\n",
    "* string (or text/letters)\n",
    "* Boolean (True/False statements)\n",
    "\n",
    "These types of data types can be useful when trying to represent a value. For example, you would not want a variable meant to represent someone's name with an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions (College Board's Essential Knowledge):\n",
    "1. What exactly IS a variable?\n",
    "2. What is the best data type to represent someone's dog's name?\n",
    "3. Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values?\n",
    "4. What is the best way to represent someone's phone number?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus (Not required but important to know): \n",
    "1. How can we update a variable's value\n",
    "2. What function is used to recieve a user's input?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks\n",
    "- As your code becomes increasingly more complex, variables and their names will make reading and fixing your code easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create code that...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses variables\n",
    "- Show your understanding of different variable data types by using at least 2 different types in your code\n",
    "- Uses meaningful names to prevent confusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rubric 0.2/0.2\n",
    "- Code needs to function\n",
    "- Data types are properly used for their given function\n",
    "- Each variable has identification to prevent confusion\n",
    "- Each Variable is utilized for their intended purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variables (3.1.2) - Noor\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objective for 3.1.2:\n",
    "Determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment\n",
    "- done through looking at how we can use the assignment operator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note:\n",
    "Collegeboard uses <-- as the assignment operator\n",
    "- The assignment operator looks different for different types of coding languages\n",
    "A variable will take the most recent value assigned\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do you even store a value inside a variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use python for our example:\n",
    "   - In python, the assignment operator is the equal sign (=)\n",
    "   - In order to store a value inside a variable, we must:\n",
    "       - Give the variable a name\n",
    "       - place the assignment operator \n",
    "       - input the variable value\n",

    "\n",
    "## JavaScript Example\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's get a little more practical here\n",
    "Imagine that you are making a calendar and have just finished the html code that is needed:\n",
    "- You now want to be able to switch between the months of the year by using the \"next\" or \"prev\" buttons\n",
    "    - you will need to take the html elements and use them to your advantage\n",
    "        - but how?\n",

    "\n",
    "## Recap:\n",
    "- We learned what is a assignment operator\n",
    "- We learned how to use the assignment operator\n",
    "- We learned how to store a value inside a variable using the assignment operator\n",
    "- We experimented with a few examples \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks: \n",
    "Answer these:\n",
    "- In your **own** words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is\n",
    "- In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables?\n",
    "- A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks:\n",
    "Copy the all the html code into a markdown file and run your local server. You will then see a decimal to binary converter near the html code. The problem is that it is not converting the decimal to binary. This is because the variables are not defined properly and it is your job to use the information learned today to fix the converter. **Don't change the css**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus (optional):\n",
    "There's more than one way to define the variable. List two ways to do it.\n",

    "#### For .15:\n",

    "## Data abstraction can be created with lists.\n",
    "- Lists bundle together multiple elements and/or variables under one name are not defined with specified lengths. \n",
    "- The variables that are stored in a list do not have to be limited to one kind of variable. \n",
    "- The user does not need to know how the list stores data (this gives way for data abstraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "## In the code below, the logic itself works with a list, but the code abstracts it into a sequence of bits in a string (as seen in the input and output). To make this work, the splitbits lists is created and processed. At the end of the code, the result is outputted as a string rather than a list (abstraction).\n",

    "## Hacks\n",

    "- The following code is incomplete. Its intended purpose is to increase three numbers, all of which ask for user input, by an amount specified the user. The input code is abstracted, but the actual logic isn't connected to the abstraction.\n",

    "- Simplification\n",
    "    - It is much simpler, faster, and easier to code lists this way\n",
    "    - Makes the code segment much easier to read\n",

    "    - You do not need as many variables, because you can just assign all corresponding values to a single variable\n",

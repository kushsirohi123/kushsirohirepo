# Student 1 
| Category  | My score | College board | Commentary |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Program Purpose and Function| 1  | 0 | The student shows that he has a clear understanding of the program function and purpose and does show the program function. 
| Data Abstraction|1   | 0 |The program shows  that the student has a an understanding of data abstraction and  it to improve the program's functionality.
 |
| Managing Complexity| 1 | 0 | The program shows a good understanding of managing complexity. When it comes to implementing the complexity, the student does that well 
 |
| Procedural Abstraction	  | 1 | 0 |  The program shows a base understanding of procedural abstraction and implements it to improve the program's functionality.
 |
| Algorithm Implementation	  | 1 | 0 |  The program shows a  understanding of algorithm implementation and implemets it well. 
| Testing | 1| 1| the student clearly demonstrates the program and its code|

# Student 2

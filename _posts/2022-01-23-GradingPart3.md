# Student 1 
| Category  | My score | College board | Commentary |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Program Purpose and Function| 0  | 1 | The student does not show that he has a clear understanding of the program function and purpose and does not show the program function. 
| Data Abstraction|0 | 0 |The program does not show that the student has a an understanding of data abstraction|
| Managing Complexity| 0 | 0 | The program does not understanding of managing complexity. When it comes to implementing the complexity, there is not enough material
 |
| Procedural Abstraction	  | 0 | 0 |  The program does not show understanding of procedural abstraction and implements it to improve the program's functionality.
 |
| Algorithm Implementation	  | 1 | 0 |  The program shows an understanding of algorithm implementation and implemets it well. 
| Testing | 1| 1|the student clearly demonstrates the program and its code|

# Student 2
| Category  | My score | College board | Commentary |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Program Purpose and Function| 1 | 1 | The student shows that he has a clear understanding of the program function and†ns purpose and does show the program function. 
| Data Abstraction|1  | 1 |The program shows  that the sudent has an understanding of data abstraction and  it to improve the program's functionality.
 |
| Managing Complexity| 1| 1 | The program shows a good understanding of managing complexity. When it comes to implementing the complexity, the student does that well 
 |
| Procedural Abstraction	  | 1 | 1 |  The program shows a base understanding of procedural abstraction and implements it to improve the program's functionality.
 |
| Algorithm Implementation	  | 1 | 1 |  The program shows an understanding of algorithm implementation and implemets it well. 
| Testing | 1| 1| the student clearly demonstrates the program and its code|

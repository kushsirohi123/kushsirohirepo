# Future Feature: Learning Feature  
## Program purpose and function

    The purpose of the learning feature will make it so when users press a help button, they can get a guide to the different buttons on the site, and if you hover over a button, it gives you a short descruptoon. 

## Data Abstraction

    I would use lists, classes, dictionaries to hold the data values such as the suggestions, and when I need to, I would index those values to show. 

## Procedural Abstraction

    I would use a function that allowed me to make a checkpoint, so when you resolve the help description, it would see that you read it and would complete the training module for that part. 

# Algorithm Implementation

    I would create an algorithm that checks if the user has completed the training module and accordinly notifies the user to do that.

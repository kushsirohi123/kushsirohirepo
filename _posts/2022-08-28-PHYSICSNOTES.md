##Velocity lab
Purpose:  
- To understand the difference between displacement and position. 
- To calculate an average velocity. 
- To analyze average velocity by using a graph.
- To extrapolate from a graph.
- To see the relationship between displacement, time, and average speed.
 Process:
  Use chalk or blue tape to mark off 1 meter sections on the floor, up to 5 meters.
Run the Tumble Buggy several times and decide how you are going to measure the start and stop times.
Use a stopwatch to measure the time it takes the Buggy to travel from 0 to 1 meters, 0 to 2 meters, 0 to 3 meters, 0 to 4 meters, and 0 to 5 meters.  Do 3 trials for all distances and take an average time for each distance.
Create a clean and easy-to-follow table to input all of the numbers from the above process.
Graph:
  Create a full-page graph with position (meters) on the y-axis and average time (seconds) on the x-axis.  Label this the “slow car”.
What would a car that moves twice as fast look like on this graph? Using another color, create another line on the same graph showing how a hypothetical “fast car” would travel if the “fast car” can go 2 times faster than the “slow car”.
Using a third color, create another line on the same graph showing the “slow car” traveling in the opposite direction (have the car start at 5 m and move to 0 m). Label this “reverse car.”
Analysis:
  Calculate the slope of each line. What are the units associated with the slope?  What does this imply about the meaning of the value of the slope?
Does the slope change?  What does this indicate about the motion of the car?
Which car is associated with the greater slope?  What general statement can be made that relates the slope of the best fit line to the speed of the car?
Determine the time it took for the slow car to reach the 2.5 m mark.  Where was slow car at the time t = 12.5 s?
Based on the data you collected, how long would it take the fast car to get to a six meter mark?  Where would the slow car be after 12 seconds?
Using the relationships between change in position and the change in time, predict how long it would take the fast car to travel 45 m.  What would be the change in the position of the slow car after 50 s?
What would be the average speed of the slow car if it traveled from the zero to the five meter mark (use the time from your data table)?  Average velocity?
What would be the average speed of the slow car if it traveled from the zero to the five meter mark and back to the zero mark (double the time)?  Average velocity?

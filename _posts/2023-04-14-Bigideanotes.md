- Binary has the prefix Bi-nary, meaning 2. It has 2 numbers, 0 or 1. 


1 - Represents an electrical signal to your computer being on

0 - Represents an electrical signal in your computer being off

Bit - is short for binary digit and is equal to 0 or 1 

Byte - group of 8 bits (1's or 0's)

Circuits in a computer's processor is made up of billions of transistors. The transistor is a switch and it is either on or off. 1 or 0 is used in binary to reflect wether it is on or off.

- everything in your computer is converted to binary. Software, music, documents, are all stored in sequences of binary.
- A byte of information is used to represent instructions to the computer

- A computer uses abstraction when it comes to binary, because we don't need to know all the processes it does with binary to make the computer function

Sampling- measures the values of the analog signal at regular intervals 
    - measured to figure out the exact bits required to create and store analog data in digital form

# NOTE TO SELF: understand analog and sampling

## Binary Numbers:

Using bits in data can have consequences, such as overflow, round-off, and other errors

Overflow error - error when the number is too large for the number of bits in a program. It would represent the number in a different way 

Round-off error- Different rounding methods during calculation has different outputs. When a number has an infinite value such as pi, it gets rounded to a number within its range depending on its range

  <p>Velocity lab
Purpose:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To understand the difference between displacement and position.</li>
    <li>To calculate an average velocity.</li>
    <li>To analyze average velocity by using a graph.</li>
    <li>To extrapolate from a graph.</li>
    <li>To see the relationship between displacement, time, and average speed.
 Process:
      <ul>
        <li>Use chalk or blue tape to mark off 1 meter sections on the floor, up to 5 meters.
Run the Tumble Buggy several times and decide how you are going to measure the start and stop times.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use a stopwatch to measure the time it takes the Buggy to travel from 0 to 1 meters, 0 to 2 meters, 0 to 3 meters, 0 to 4 meters, and 0 to 5 meters.  Do 3 trials for all distances and take an average time for each distance.
Create a clean and easy-to-follow table to input all of the numbers from the above process.</li>
    <li>Graph:
Create a full-page graph with position (meters) on the y-axis and average time (seconds) on the x-axis.  Label this the “slow car”.
What would a car that moves twice as fast look like on this graph? Using another color, create another line on the same graph showing how a hypothetical “fast car” would travel if the “fast car” can go 2 times faster than the “slow car”.
Using a third color, create another line on the same graph showing the “slow car” traveling in the opposite direction (have the car start at 5 m and move to 0 m). Label this “reverse car.”</li>
    <li>Analysis:
Calculate the slope of each line. What are the units associated with the slope?  What does this imply about the meaning of the value of the slope?
Does the slope change?  What does this indicate about the motion of the car?
Which car is associated with the greater slope?  What general statement can be made that relates the slope of the best fit line to the speed of the car?
Determine the time it took for the slow car to reach the 2.5 m mark.  Where was slow car at the time t = 12.5 s?
Based on the data you collected, how long would it take the fast car to get to a six meter mark?  Where would the slow car be after 12 seconds?
Using the relationships between change in position and the change in time, predict how long it would take the fast car to travel 45 m.  What would be the change in the position of the slow car after 50 s?
What would be the average speed of the slow car if it traveled from the zero to the five meter mark (use the time from your data table)?  Average velocity?
What would be the average speed of the slow car if it traveled from the zero to the five meter mark and back to the zero mark (double the time)?  Average velocity?

<h1 id="acceleration-lab-analysis-questions">Acceleration Lab Analysis Questions</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What are the units of the slope for your velocity vs time graph? What does the slope represent?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The slope represents the acceleration of the object and the units are meters per second (m/s). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe the shape of the position vs time graphs. What does the shape of your position time graph tell you about the motion of the car?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The shape represents velocity, which is displacement over time. The shape gives detail of the slope, which is the velocity of the position v. time. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What shape is the acceleration vs time graph? What does the shape of the graph tell you about the motion of the car?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The shape is exponential because as the car changed its position downward, the velocity increased. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When did the car have the highest acceleration? What causes the cars to accelerate?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The car had the highest acceleration at the end of the racetrack according to our graphs. What causes the acceleration was the change of velocity the cars experienced on the track depending on the height that they were at. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compare your acceleration values from the kinematic section to the Motion Tracker section of your data. Which was likely more accurate? Explain your reasoning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The kinematics section was  likely more accurate. During our motion tracker, there were different variables, such as the slope of the table, the variance in length, and whatnot. Since the kinematics was an equation, I would say it’s more accurate. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examine the velocity time graph below and answer the following.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe the motion of a car that creates this graph. When is the car accelerating, when is its motion constant?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The car accelerates, then moves with constant velocity, then accelerates, then stops moving altogether. A flat line on a velocity time graph represents a constant motion. A flat line on the x axis on a velocity time graph represents no motion. Lines on a velocity time graph with slopes that are not 0 represent motion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calculate the acceleration from 0-14 seconds, 14-44 seconds and 44-54 seconds.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>0-14: 1.92 m/s^2
  14-44: 0 m/s^2
  44-54: -4 m/s^2</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sketch a velocity vs time graph that is speeding up in the negative direction.
